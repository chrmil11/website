  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Christopher Millan and I am from Skokie, Illinois. I am a 4th
    year co-terminal student in the Illinois Institute of Technology pursuing my
    bachelor's and master's degree in computer science. Some of my favorite hobbies
    to do include video gaming, bowling, volleyball, and playing the piano. I also
    enjoy listening to all kinds of music, but I would say my favorite genres are
    R&amp;B, hip hop, blues, jazz, ballads, and sometimes classical.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think my earliest influence towards computer science would be from my own
    father, who is an IT in his own work. Probably one of my most memorable tidbits
    would be in grade school, where he took me with him to my school to help set up
    the new computer lab, even though I definitely had maybe a ten percent
    understanding of what we were actually doing on a technical level. However, it
    took me until my senior year of high school to actually be introduced to the
    field of computer science via an AP course. I was extremely intrigued learning
    how to program and making algorithms that I spontaneously jumped into my first
    coding competition with probably a month and a half of basic Java knowledge. I
    didn't know much, but brute force got me and my partner 13th out of 40 pairs, a
    free shirt, and new knowledge of functionalities that I haven't learned yet. The
    awe, frustration, and excitement I felt from that day inspired me to continue to
    follow this computing path.

    I remember from my CS 331: Data Structures course when my instructor was
    giving his introduction about his class, and he asked the students, &quot;What is
    computer science?&quot; He then proceeded to split up the term. &quot;Well, computers
    are just things that compute. And being computer scientists, that must mean
    we work with computers all the time, right?&quot; I would've said yes, but he
    shut down my response saying that we probably spend 10 to 20 percent of our
    time coding in front of a computer. &quot;Then what about science? Is it a
    science like biology, physics, or chemistry?&quot; Kind of. There is research and
    testing involved, but we don't get a fancy lab coat. &quot;Then what in the world
    does a computer scientist do?&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    He flips to the next slide and proceeds on to saying, &quot;We're just professional
    problem solvers.&quot; That definition has stuck to me ever since, because I knew
    this was what I wanted to do. Not only to solve problems, but to create
    solutions as optimally as possible. I'm the type of person that would sit down
    and think to myself, &quot;What can I do to make it better?&quot; I incorporate this
    mindset into everything that I do, because there isn't a perfect solution yet to
    a lot of the problems we encounter, but there is always some room for improving
    those solutions. Maybe there's a better and faster algorithm that should be
    used. Maybe the product needs to be more user-friendly. I might not be the
    genius that would come out with some sort of groundbreaking algorithm (although
    that would be pretty cool), but on a practical level, I want to be the type of
    person that can come up with reliable and optimal solutions that can be used by
    people throughout their every day lives - with or without code.
