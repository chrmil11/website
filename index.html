  <h1>Christopher Millan</h1>
  <p>
    Hey everyone! I'm Christopher Millan and I'm a 4th year BS/MS Computer
    Science student commuting from Skokie, IL. I would say that I'm pretty shy
    and prefer listening over speaking, but don't tell me to remember anything
    for you because I have terrible memory. I can play the piano and the
    trombone (though I'm quite rusty) and enjoy going bowling and playing
    volleyball. Nice to meet you all! (Hey, that rhymes)
  </p>
