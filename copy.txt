Hey everyone! I'm Christopher Millan and I'm a 4th year BS/MS Computer Science
student commuting from Skokie, IL. I would say that I'm pretty shy and prefer
listening over speaking, but don't tell me to remember anything for you because
I have terrible memory. I can play the piano and the trombone (though I'm quite
rusty) and enjoy going bowling and playing volleyball. Nice to meet you all!
(Hey, that rhymes)
