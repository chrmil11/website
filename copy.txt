Hello! My name is Christopher Millan and I am from Skokie, Illinois. I am a 4th
year co-terminal student in the Illinois Institute of Technology pursuing my
bachelor's and master's degree in computer science. Some of my favorite hobbies
to do include video gaming, bowling, volleyball, and playing the piano. I also
enjoy listening to all kinds of music, but I would say my favorite genres are
R&B, hip hop, blues, jazz, ballads, and sometimes classical.
